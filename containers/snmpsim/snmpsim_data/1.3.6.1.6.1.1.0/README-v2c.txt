This directory serves as a special case when Simulator is running
in --v2c-arch mode.

This is a community name AND transport domain specific directory.

The .snmprec files in this directory would be used by Simulator whenever
community name in request is empty AND transport domain AND source address
being used matches the .snmprec filename.
